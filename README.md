# AI-starter-pack-in-cpp

The current repository hosts source code in C++ and PDDL, that deals with fundamental problems in the fields of Artificial Intelligence. In particular, in this repository you can find source code for:

<ul>
  <li>Solving an N-puzzle with several search algorithms:
    <ul>
      <li>Depth-first search (DFS)</li>
      <li>Breadth-first search (BFS)</li>
      <li>Best-first search (BestFS)</li>
      <li>A Start search (A*)</li>
   </ul> </li>
  <li>Planning actions for winning in a D&D-like game</li>
</ul>


The source code was developed alongside with the course "Artificial Intelligence" the author attended during his 4th semester of undergraduate studies at School of Informatics AUTh. Apart from the source code, in each one of the above dealt issues you can find a description of the problem that is to solve, as well as a technical report written by the author, providing information about the reasoning and the implementation of the solutions. Up to that moment, both the problem descriptions and the reports are only in greek. However, uploading an english version of them, as well, is of high priority to the author in the near future.

For any issues, comments or ideas feel free to contact the author.
